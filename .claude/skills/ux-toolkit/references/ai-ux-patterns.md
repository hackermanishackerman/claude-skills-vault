### Error Message Patterns

```
Generic AI failure:
"I couldn't complete that request.
 Try rephrasing or [use manual option]."

Content generation failure:
"I wasn't able to generate content for this.
 Here are some templates you can customize."

Recognition failure:
"I couldn't identify that clearly.
 Try with better lighting or a different angle."

Rate limit:
"I'm handling many requests right now.
 Please try again in a moment."
```
